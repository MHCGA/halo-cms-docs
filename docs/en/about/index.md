# About This Project

## Why we started

The Halo CMS community has plenty of scattered knowledge about plugins, themes, and operations, but it lacks a curated space that stays up to date. By collaborating as a community, we aim to build a sustainable knowledge base that helps creators launch and grow their Halo sites faster.

## What kinds of contributions we need

- In-depth technical articles that share key ideas, pitfalls, and best practices for plugin or theme development.
- Standout site showcases that illustrate how Halo works in different scenarios.
- Tooling and workflow guides that improve development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
- Community insights and interviews that document the stories of the Halo ecosystem.

Ready to share your experience? Start with the [contribution guide](/en/contributing/) and help us grow the Halo knowledge base together.
