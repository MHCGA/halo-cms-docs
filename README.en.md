## About This Project

The Halo CMS community has accumulated extensive hands-on experience with plugins, themes, operations, and ecosystem expansion, though the resources are often scattered. We aim to build a high-quality, sustainable knowledge base through community collaboration to help creators launch and grow their Halo sites faster.

The Halo CMS Knowledge Base continuously covers:

- **In-depth technical articles**: Share key ideas, pitfalls, and best practices for plugin or theme development.
- **Standout site showcases**: Showcase Halo solutions in different scenarios.
- **Tooling and workflow guides**: Continuously improve development, testing, deployment, monitoring and other supporting guides.
- **Community insights and interviews**: Document stories and participants of the Halo ecosystem.
