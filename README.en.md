## About the Site

Halo CMS builders share tons of scattered knowledge about plugins, themes, operations, and cross-ecosystem tooling. This repository aims to centralize that know-how in a bilingual (ZH/EN) knowledge base covering:

- Plugin and theme development, debugging, release workflows
- Site operations, content workflows, automation, deployment
- Collaboration between plugins and themes, community showcases, tooling guides

Visit the production site at [https://howiehz.top/mhcga](https://howiehz.top/mhcga).

## Documentation Map

The full navigation, bilingual content, and submission workflow live on the site itself (`/en/posts/`) and inside the [contribution guide](docs/en/contributing/index.md). This README stays minimal to avoid maintaining duplicate copies of the same structure.

---

## Local Development & Preview

All setup commands (install, dev, build, preview, lint/format, deploy) are documented once in [Contribution Guide · Quick Start](docs/en/contributing/index.md#quick-start). Please refer there to keep instructions synchronized with the docs site.

---

## How to Contribute

Submission paths (articles, issues, reviews, automation work) are fully documented in [docs/en/contributing/index.md](docs/en/contributing/index.md). Follow that single source for frontmatter rules, reviewer expectations, and automation notes.

---

## FAQ

The FAQ, translation policy, and environment assumptions are centralized in the [contribution guide](docs/en/contributing/index.md). For anything else, open an issue and we’ll help out.

## License

Code remains under [MIT License](LICENSE); documentation falls under CC BY-SA 4.0 + SATA. For detailed obligations, scenarios, and citation guidance, see [docs/en/license/index.md](docs/en/license/index.md).
